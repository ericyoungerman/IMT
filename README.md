The ECOBEAN Interrow Mowing Trial

In collaboration with the University of Wisconsin, the University of Maine, the University of Vermont, and the Hudson Valley Farmh Hub, this project examines interrow mowing in organic no-till dry beans. Specifically, it investigates how the timing and frequency of mowing events impacts weed biomass, weed seed production, and bean yield. 

This work began in the Fall of 2022 and will continue through 2025.

This work is funded by a Northeast SARE Research and Education grant (RE22-019) and USDA-NIFA Award number 2022-51300-37881
